TailwindCSS-practiceProject

## Overview

This project is a simple blog about plants and gardening, built using Tailwind CSS. It serves as a hands-on practice project for the Scrimba CSS Tailwind course. The HTML structure is inspired by the course's example, while the CSS is written using Tailwind CSS to reinforce learning about utility-first styling and various Tailwind properties.
